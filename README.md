# unit-system-miscellaneous-units
A set of pre-made unites for my Unit System. This is not intended to be used in production code, as the list of units will grow to be very large. If you want to use any of these units in production code, request a spin-off repository (which will be imported into this one to maintain backwards compatibility)..
