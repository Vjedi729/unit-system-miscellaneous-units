# Unit System

This an NPM package containing system for creating and combining units to streamline dimensional analysis and simplify unit conversion.

It is intended to be used with other packages which implement sets of units (such as the SI units, US Imperial units, etc.). 

It is also more streamlined to use this system in combination with the Number-like system (available at [Vjedi729/number-like](https://github.com/Vjedi729/number-like)), using the UnitNumber sample. 

# Pre-built Units

The SI units (basic and derived) are available at https://github.com/Vjedi729/unit-system-SI-units
